# Code workspaces cleaner upper

Simple "script" to automatically search for and clean up unused rust build folders to save space. Includes features like detailed error messages, recursive symlink detection(and avoidance), and the ability to have it only list out folders that would be deleted and not actually delete them. The code is quite low quality.
